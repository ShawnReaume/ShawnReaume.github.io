                My professional journey has been shaped by my genuine interest in geospatial
                technologies and their application to environmental conservation. As such, the
                Canadian Wildlife Service would be a perfect fit for my interests and skills. I am
                currently completing a GIS graduate certificate at the Centre of Geographic Sciences
                (COGS) and a Bachelor's in Human Geography at Concordia University. These
                experiences have provided me with a robust technical foundation and a practical
                understanding of geospatial technologies. My previous studies and experience in
                business administration, human resources, and customer service have also taught me
                teamwork, problem-solving, and conflict resolution skills, which I find crucial for
                effective collaboration. Joining the CWS would be an amazing opportunity for me. I
                am keen to apply my skills and dedication to contribute meaningfully to national
                conservation efforts while embracing the opportunity for continuous learning and
                growth in such an impactful branch.
